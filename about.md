I am Evan Dekhayser, and I am currently a senior in high school who programs and writes about programming.		 +This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
  		  
Soon, I will update this page with a compilation of projects I have worked on. Until then, feel free to email me or search the interwebs if you have any questions.
